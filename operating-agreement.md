(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if the Manager(s) associated with a Series approve, a Manager associated with such Series, any officers, directors, shareholders, partners, members, employees, representatives or agents of such Manager, or their respective affiliates, or any employee or agent of such Series (each, a "Covered Person") shall be entitled to indemnification from such Series for any loss, damage or claim incurred by such Covered Person by reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such Covered Person in good faith on behalf of the Company or such Series and in a manner reasonably believed to be within the scope of authority conferred on such Covered Person by this Agreement and any Separate Series Agreement, except that no Covered Person shall be entitled to be indemnified in respect of any loss, damage or claim incurred by such Covered Person by reason of fraud, deceit, gross negligence, willful misconduct or a wrongful taking with respect to such acts or omissions; provided, however, that any indemnity under this Section 5.06 shall be provided out of and to the extent of the assets of the such Series only, and no Covered Person or any other Series shall have any personal liability on account thereof.

(b)To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if the Manager(s) associated with a Series approve, expenses (including legal fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by such Series prior to the final disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by such Series of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay such amount if it shall be determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section 5.06.

(c) A Series may purchase and maintain insurance, to the extent and in such amounts as the Managers associated with such Series shall deem reasonable, on behalf of Covered Persons and such other Persons as the Managers associated with such Series shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that may be incurred by any such Person in connection with the activities of such Series or such indemnities, regardless of whether such Series would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement. A Series may enter into indemnity contracts with Covered Persons and such other Persons as the Managers associated with such Series shall determine and adopt written procedures pursuant to which arrangements are made for the advancement of expenses and the funding of obligations under this Section 5.06 and containing such other procedures regarding indemnification as are appropriate.

The removal of a Manager who is also a Member shall not affect the Manager’s rights as a Member and shall not constitute a withdrawal of a Member unless the removal was for cause. In such a case, the Member shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the Series. Cause shall mean proven embezzlement (including non-participation in the Redistribution Protocol), drug or alcohol use which materially interferes with job performance, absenteeism in excess of two times normal Company policy, wrongful disclosure of Company’s confidential information, conflict of interest, gross insubordination, or conviction of a felony adversely affecting the ability of the Manager to carry on his or her normal duties.

Any Manager’s position to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of Managers shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Managers then in office or by an election at a special meeting of Voting Members called for that purpose or by the Voting Members’ majority written consent. A Manager elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office and shall hold office until expiration of such term and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.

The balance of the purchase price provided for in Sub Article 8.12 of this Agreement shall be paid in the form of a promissory note for said sum (the "Promissory Note"), to be amortized with equal monthly payments of principal and interest over a term of five (5) years. The first payment on the Promissory Note shall be made on the first day of the second calendar month immediately following the settlement date, and payments of principal and interest shall continue on the first day of each calendar month thereafter for an additional fifty nine (59) calendar months, when the entire unpaid balance of principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall be fully due and payable. The interest to be paid on the Promissory Note shall be fixed at the lowest simple interest rate specified under Article 483 (or any successor Articles) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, required to be charged in order to avoid the imposition of "unstated interest." At the end of each calendar year during the term of the Promissory Note, the rate of interest to be paid on the Promissory Note shall be adjusted for the new calendar year to be fixed at the lowest simple interest rate specified under Article 483 (or any successor Articles) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, required to be charged in order to avoid the imposition of "unstated interest." All or any part of the Promissory Note may be prepaid at any time, and from time to time, without penalty.

c. Additional Provisions for Promissory Note. In addition to the provisions set forth in Sub Article 8.13(b) of this Agreement, the Promissory Note shall also provide for the following: (i) if the maker of the Promissory Note is the Company, a provision requiring the joint and several personal guaranty of all of the Members other than the Transferring Member; (ii) if the maker of the Promissory Note are the Members, a provision requiring the guaranty of the Company; (iii) a provision for the Confession of Judgment against the maker of the Promissory Note and the Guarantor(s); (iv) a provision requiring the payment of the entire unpaid principal balance of the Promissory Note, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, in the event there is a sale or exchange of substantially all of the Company property or substantially all of the Company interests of the Members, as the case may be; and (v) a provision requiring the payment of a five (5%) percent late penalty for any payment more than fifteen (15) days overdue.

The Promissory Note or the Guaranty, whichever is made by the Company, shall be secured by (i) a mortgage on the real property of the Company, if any, subordinate only to mortgage liens outstanding at the time of the purchase of the Company interest proposed for sale and/or (ii) a security interest in the personal property of the Company, if any, subordinate only to security interests outstanding at the time of the purchase of the Company interest proposed for sale, as the case may be. The aforesaid mortgage lien and/or security interest shall be equal in priority to any lien previously placed on such property as a result of a prior purchase of a Company interest proposed for sale under this Agreement, except that the Company shall not be required to grant a mortgage lien and/or security interest to any Transferring Member if that would cause a default under any existing mortgage, loan agreement, or security agreement to which the Company is a party or promissory note of which the Company is the maker. The Company shall take all reasonable steps necessary to secure the approvals of all other parties to such instruments to permit it to mortgage its real property or grant a security interest in its personal property without causing a default under such instruments.

e. Third Party Offer. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Sub Article 8.13 of this Agreement to the contrary, if the purchase of the Company interest proposed for sale is the result of an exercise of a right of first refusal by the Company as provided in Sub Article 8.11 of this Agreement, then the terms for the payment of the purchase price shall be those set forth in the third party offer.

f. Smart Contract. If a smart contract is agreed upon by both parties as being capable of performing the same function as a Promissory Note, it may be executed by both parties instead.

###### Section 8.15 Costs and Expenses of Transfer.
