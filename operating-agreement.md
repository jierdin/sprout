WHEREAS, it is intended by the parties hereto that each property acquired by the Company shall be a separate series with respect to the Members of the Company and that the debts, liabilities and obligations incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular series of the Company will be enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets of the Company generally or any other series thereof, and none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the Company generally or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and obligations contained herein, the parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

“Depreciation” shall mean, with respect to a Series, and for each Fiscal Year or other period, an amount equal to the depreciation, amortization or other cost recovery deduction allowable with respect to an asset associated with such Series for such Fiscal Year or other period; provided, however, that if the Gross Asset Value of an asset associated with such Series differs from its adjusted basis for federal income-tax purposes at the beginning of such Fiscal Year or other period, Depreciation shall be an amount that bears the same ratio to such beginning Gross Asset Value as the federal income-tax depreciation, amortization or other cost recovery deduction with respect to such asset for such Fiscal Year or other period bears to such beginning adjusted tax basis; and provided further, that if the federal income-tax deprecia­tion, amortization or other cost recovery deduction for such Fiscal Year or other period is zero, Depreciation shall be determined with reference to such beginning Gross Asset Value using any reasonable method selected by Members associated with such Series holding a Majority Interest in such Series.

“Distributable Cash” shall mean, with respect to a Series, all cash, cryptocurrencies, revenues and funds received by the Company with respect to such Series from such Series' operations, less the sum of the following to the extent paid or set aside by the Company with respect to such Series: (i) all principal and interest payments on indebtedness of the Company with respect to such Series and all other sums paid to lenders with respect to such Series; (ii) all cash expenditures incurred in the normal operation of the Company’s business with respect to such Series; and (iii) such Reserves as the Members associated with such Series deem reasonably necessary for the proper operation of the Company's business with respect to such Series.

(ii) the Gross Asset Value of all Company assets associated with a Series shall be adjusted to equal their respective gross fair market values, as determined by Members associated with such Series holding a Majority Interest in such Series, as of the following times: (a) the acquisition of an additional interest in the Company with respect to such Series by any new or existing Member in exchange for more than a de minimis Capital Contribution; (b) the distribution by the Company with respect to such Series to a Member of more than a de minimis amount of Company assets associated with such Series as consideration for an interest in the Company; and (c) the liquidation of the Company within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)­(g); provided, however, that adjustments pursuant to Clause (a) and Clause (b) of this sentence shall be made only if Members associated with such Series holding a Majority Interest in such Series reasonably determine that such adjustments are necessary or appropriate to reflect the relative economic interests of the Members in such Series; and

(iii) the Gross Asset Value of any Company asset associated with a Series that is distributed to any Member shall be the gross fair market value of such asset on the date of distri­bution, as determined by Members associated with such Series holding a Majority Interest in such Series.

If the Gross Asset Value of an asset has been determined or adjusted pursuant to Paragraph (i) or Paragraph (ii) above, such Gross Asset Value shall thereafter be adjusted by the Depreciation taken into account with respect to such asset for purposes of computing Profits and Losses.

“Majority Interest” shall mean, with respect to a Series or the Company as applicable, the vote of Membership Interests of one or more Members that in the aggregate exceed 50% of all VOTING Percentage Interests owned by Members associated with respect to such Series or the Company as applicable.

Each Manager associated with a Series shall perform his or her duties as a Manager of the Company associated with such Series in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Company and such Series, and with such care as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. A Manager associated with a Series shall not be liable to the Company, such Series, or to any other Voting Member for any loss or damage sustained by the Company, such Series or such Voting Member, unless the loss or damage shall have been the result of fraud, deceit, gross negligence, willful misconduct or a wrongful taking by the Manager.

 d. Security for Promissory Note. The Promissory Note or the Guaranty, whichever is made by the Company, shall be secured by (i) a mortgage on the real property of the Company, if any, subordinate only to mortgage liens outstanding at the time of the purchase of the Company interest proposed for sale and/or (ii) a security interest in the personal property of the Company, if any, subordinate only to security interests outstanding at the time of the purchase of the Company interest proposed for sale, as the case may be. The aforesaid mortgage lien and/or security interest shall be equal in priority to any lien previously placed on such property as a result of a prior purchase of a Company interest proposed for sale under this Agreement, except that the Company shall not be required to grant a mortgage lien and/or security interest to any Transferring Member if that would cause a default under any existing mortgage, loan agreement, or security agreement to which the Company is a party or promissory note of which the Company is the maker. The Company shall take all reasonable steps necessary to secure the approvals of all other parties to such instruments to permit it to mortgage its real property or grant a security interest in its personal property without causing a default under such instruments.

e. Third Party Offer. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Sub Article 8.13 of this Agreement to the contrary, if the purchase of the Company interest proposed for sale is the result of an exercise of a right of first refusal by the Company as provided in Sub Article 8.11 of this Agreement, then the terms for the payment of the purchase price shall be those set forth in the third party offer.
